# A_Life

This project was developed during my time at the Design Research Lab. It explores rule-based behaviors between populations of agents, which are in constant negotiation with themselves and their environment. At the heart of these rulesets is a communication strategy between agents which produces global organizations from bottom up logics. 

The whole project was written in C# in Unity 3D. This project was developed for research purposes only and is not intended for any commercial use.
